    There is no denying that 2020 continues to be a rough year
    with pandemic related stresses from loneliness, distance learning, and
    financial uncertainty. During these difficult times,
    the availability of mental health re-sources is more vital than ever.
    This website is designed to help connect youth and young adults with mental
    health and self-care resources.

    <h5><em>What is Self-Care?</em></h5>

    Self care is any activity that we do to deliberately take care of our mental, emotional, and physical health.
    This could mean:
    <br />
    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li>watching a favorite movie</li>
        <li>going for a run</li>
        <li>eating something delicious</li>
    </ul>
    Self-care is vast and really
    comes down to practicing self-compassion and feeling good.
